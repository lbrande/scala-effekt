# Scala Effekt
The **Effekt** library allows you to structure your effectful programs
in a functional way. It thus represents an alternative to traditional
monad transformer based program structuring techniques.

This version of **Effekt** requires a [Loom enabled JDK](https://jdk.java.net/loom/) as it utilizes "virtual threads" for increased performance.

Make sure to check out the examples.
